================

An angularjs directive that wraps [intro.js](http://usablica.github.io/intro.js/) functionality.

See [the project page](http://code.mendhak.com/angular-intro.js/) for an overview.

## Bower

You can install this package through `Bower` by using the following command :

    bower install angular-intro.js --save

## NPM

You can install this package through `NPM` by using the following command :

    npm install angular-intro.js --save

## Webpack

You can use this package in your webpack project, first by including `intro.js` and its css file. Next you need to require this package.

  import ngIntro from 'angular-intro.js';

This project will return the whole angular module so if you want to use as a dependency in your own angular module you would need to reference the name `ngIntro.name`.

## How to use

It's possible to include on your controller the service `ngIntroService` and customize as you need, or you may configure on your view the directives which are `ng-intro-options`,  `ng-intro-method` and `ng-intro-disable-button`.

### Setting Options

**As a directive** - `ng-intro-options="IntroOptions"`

**As a service** - `ngIntroService.setOptions(IntroOptions)`

You should create a `$scope.IntroOptions` in your controller which contains the intro.js options. The options are exactly the same as [the original](https://github.com/usablica/intro.js/wiki/Documentation#options).  This also allows you to modify the options as part of your controller behavior if necessary.  You don't have to use `IntroOptions`, you can specify some other name.

### Start method

**As a directive** -  `ng-intro-method="CallMe"`

**As a service** - `ngIntroService.start()`

The directive will create a method on `$scope.CallMe` so that you can invoke it yourself later.  Make sure the there isn't a method `CallMe` already in your controller. To use the method be sure to wrap it with `$timeout`. You don't have to use `CallMe`, you can specify some other name.

### Call the start method

You can invoke it from an event such as click.
`
ng-click="CallMe();"
`

as long as you are still in the same controller scope.  You can also specify a step number in the method call, `CallMe(3);`.

You can start the intro from code, either call `$scope.CallMe();`.  If the `$scope.CallMe();` doesn't work, it might be because your DOM isn't ready. Put it in a `$timeout`.

### Autostart

If you set `ng-intro-autostart="true"`, the intro will start as soon as the directive is ready.

### Autorefresh

If an intro tour includes dynamic content, use `ng-intro-autorefresh="true"` to call Intro.js' refresh method.

## Callbacks

Intro.js provides several callbacks.  You can receive these callbacks in your controller.  For example, for the `onchange` event, specify the function name in the directive.

### As a directive

`ng-intro-onchange="ChangeEvent"`

In your controller, create `ChangeEvent`
```javascript
    $scope.ChangeEvent = function (targetElement, scope) {
        console.log("Change Event called");
        console.log(targetElement); //The target element
        console.log(this); //The IntroJS object
    };
```

The other intro.js callbacks you can specify are `ng-intro-oncomplete`, `ng-intro-onexit`, `ng-intro-onchange`, `ng-intro-onbeforechange`, `ng-intro-onafterchange`, `ng-intro-onhintsadded`, `ng-intro-onhintclick` and `ng-intro-onhintclose`. 

### As a service

In your controller:
```javascript
    ngIntroService.onComplete(function(){
        console.log('on complete callback!')
    });
```
the list of current callbacks are:

* `onComplete`
* `onExit`
* `onBeforeChange`
* `onChange`
* `onAfterChange`
* `onHintClick`
* `onHintClose`
* `onHintsAdded`

The current short Interface is:
p.s. it's avaiable on build folder the .d.ts file
``` javascript
	intro: IntroJs;
	addListener(name: string, callback: Function): void;
	removeListener(name: string): void;
	setOptions: IntroJs.Options;
	start(stepId?: number): IntroJs;
	exit(): IntroJs;
	clear(callback: Function): IntroJs;
	goToStepNumber(stepId: number): IntroJs;
	addHints(): IntroJs;
	showHint(hintIdx: number): IntroJs;
	showHints(): IntroJs;
	hideHint(hintIdx: number): IntroJs;
	hideHints(): IntroJs;
	removeHint(stepid: number): IntroJs;
	removeHints(): IntroJs;
	previous(): IntroJs;
	next(): IntroJs;
	refresh(): IntroJs;
	onComplete(callback: Function): void;
	onExit(callback: Function): void;
	onBeforeChange(callback: Function): void;
	onAfterChange(callback: Function): void;
	onChange(callback: Function): void;
	onHintClick(callback: Function): void;
	onHintClose(callback: Function): void;
	onHintsAdded(callback: Function): void; 
```

### Exit Method

**Directive** - `ng-intro-exit-method="ExitMe"`

**Callback** - `$scope.ExitMe(function() { //callback } );`

You can also call `$scope.ExitMe()` from your controller. 


**Service** - `ngIntroService.exit()`

**Callback** - `ngIntroService.onExit(function(){
  console.log('do something.');
});`


### Plunker

You may use as Directive standalone without injecting ngIntroService [as shown here](http://plnkr.co/edit/wo9EzfbOFjM7NDoAvmjA?p=preview)

or

alternatively as Service, [as shown here](http://plnkr.co/edit/4JdONL)
*i've added the directive, but it's not required, it's there to show the compatibility between both*

## How to build

If you want to build or contribute, first, get the node modules needed (grunt, bower)

    npm install 
    p.s.: this will run `bower install` after completes :)


Then, get grunt to build the typescript into .js and the minified angular-intro.min.js

    node_modules/.bin/grunt watch
    p.s.: for faster build use `tsc --watch`, but you need run grunt after finish 

Finally, view the demo page to make sure everything's working; start a web server:

    ./node_modules/.bin/grunt connect:server

And browse to `http://localhost:8000/example/index.html`
